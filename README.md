# Getting Started

## Installation

### Installing packages

To install the API, run:

```console
npm install
```

Before proceeding, it is necessary to report that I've found some issues using SQLite3 with Node.js versions >=12. If you had any issues installing some of the packages on the previous step, the following steps are recommended:

### Setting Node.js to v10.23.1

This was the latest version I could use to run this API.

```console
 sudo npm install -g n

 sudo n 10.23.1
 ```

### Usage

To use the API, run:

```console
npm start
```

For more information on this API usage, please refer to the swagger.yaml file
